# Fudge

Fudge is a library of Clojure-inspired functions for JavaScript. it is based on 
[Squint](https://github.com/squint-cljs/squint) with some modifications to make 
it suitable for direct use in JavaScript. 

## Status
This project is experimental and there will likely be breaking changes. Do not
use in production.

## Install
`npm i fudgejs`

## Usage
